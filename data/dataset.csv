There exists an integer that can be expressed as the sum of two perfect cubes in two different ways.,Consider the number 1729. Note that 13 + 123 = 1729 and 93 + 103 = 1729. Thus the number 1729 can be expressed as the sum of two perfect cubes in two different ways
Prove that the sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula n(n+1)/2.,To prove this we use mathematical induction. Base Case: For n=1 the sum of the first natural number is 1 and the formula gives 1(1+1)/2 = 1 which is correct. Inductive Step: Assume the formula holds for n=k i.e. the sum of the first k natural numbers is k(k+1)/2. For n=k+1 the sum of the first k+1 natural numbers is (k(k+1)/2) + (k+1). Simplifying this expression yields (k+1)(k+2)/2 which is the formula for n=k+1. Thus by induction the formula holds for all natural numbers n.
Show that a graph is bipartite if and only if it does not contain an odd-length cycle.,To prove this we use the definition of bipartite graphs and the properties of odd-length cycles. A graph is bipartite if we can color its vertices using two colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. An odd-length cycle would require three or more vertices which cannot be properly colored with two colors (since you would need more than two colors to color an odd-length cycle without adjacent vertices sharing the same color). Conversely if a graph does not contain an odd-length cycle then it is possible to color the graph with two colors proving that the graph is bipartite.
If a b ∈ N then there exist integers k and ` for which gcd(a b) = ak + b`.,(Direct) Suppose a b ∈ N. Consider the set A = {ax + b y : x y ∈ Z}. This set contains both positive and negative integers as well as 0. (Reason: Let y = 0 and let x range over all integers. Then ax + b y = ax ranges over all multiples of a both positive negative and zero.) Let d be the smallest positive element of A. Then because d is in A it must have the form d = ak + b` for some specific k ` ∈ Z. To finish we will show d = gcd(a b). We will first argue that d is a common divisor of a and b and then that it is the greatest common divisor. To see that d | a use the division algorithm (page 30) to write a = qd + r for integers q and r with 0 ≤ r < d. The equation a = qd + r yields r = a − qd = a − q(ak + b`) = a(1 − qk) + b(−q`). Therefore r has form r = ax+ b y so it belongs to A. But 0 ≤ r < d and d is the smallest positive number in A so r can’t be positive; hence r = 0. Updating our equation a = qd + r we get a = qd so d | a. Repeating this argument with b = qd + r shows d | b. Thus d is indeed a common divisor of a and b. It remains to show that it is the greatest common divisor. As gcd(a b) divides a and b we have a = gcd(a b)·m and b = gcd(a b)·n for some m n ∈ Z. So d = ak+ b` = gcd(a b)· mk+gcd(a b)· n` = gcd(a b)(mk+ n`) and thus d is a multiple of gcd(a b). Therefore d ≥ gcd(a b). But d can’t be a larger common divisor of a and b than gcd(a b) so d = gcd(a b)
Suppose a b ∈ N. Then there exists a unique d ∈ N for which: An integer m is a multiple of d if and only if m = ax + b y for some x y ∈ Z.,Suppose a b ∈ N. Let d = gcd(a b). We first show that an integer m is a multiple of d if and only if m = ax + b y for some x y ∈ Z. Let m = dn be a multiple of d. By Proposition 7.1 (on the previous page) there are integers k and ` for which d = ak + b`. Then m = dn = (ak + b`)n = a(kn) + b(`n) so m = ax + b y for integers x = kn and y = `n. Conversely suppose m = ax + b y for some x y ∈ Z. Since d = gcd(a b) is a divisor of both a and b we have a = dc and b = de for some c e ∈ Z. Then m = ax + b y = dcx + de y = d(cx + e y) and this is a multiple of d. We have now shown that there is a natural number d with the property that m is a multiple of d if and only if m = ax+b y for some x y ∈ Z. It remains to show that d is the unique such natural number. To do this suppose d′ is any natural number with the property that d has: m is a multiple of d′ ⇐⇒ m = ax + b y for some x y ∈ Z. We next argue that d′ = d; that is d is the unique natural number with the stated property. m = a · 1 + b · 0 = a is a multiple of d′. Likewise m = a · 0 + b · 1 = b is a multiple of d′. Hence a and b are both multiples of d′ so d′ is a common divisor of a and b and therefore d′ ≤ gcd(a b) = d. But also the multiple m = d′ · 1 = d′ of d′ can be expressed as d′ = ax + b y for some x y ∈ Z. As noted in the second paragraph of the proof a = dc and b = de for some c e ∈ Z. Thus d′ = ax + b y = dcx + de y = d(cx + e y) so d′ is a multiple d. As d′ and d are both positive it follows that d ≤ d′. We’ve now shown that d′ ≤ d and d ≤ d′ so d = d′. The proof is complete.
